## If-Else Statements

In Python, if-else statements are used for decision making. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

```python
if condition:
    # code block to execute if condition is true
else:
    # code block to execute if condition is false
```

## For Loop
The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) and executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.
```
for element in sequence:
    # code block to execute for each element
```
## While Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```
while condition:
    # code block to execute while condition is true
```
## Functions
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it more modular and easier to maintain.
```
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block to execute
    return value
```
